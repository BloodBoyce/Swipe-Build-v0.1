# Important information
This is a basic first version of my game Swipe!
Below is some important information that is NOT yet communicated to the player inside the game.

## Goal
Currently, it has one level which is accessed by clicking 'Start Game'.
The goal is to collect 10 coins, which will trigger the "Objective Complete!" text to appear. Afterwards, you have to leave by the riverside road that has a red glow.


## Controls
Only supports keyboard + mouse for now. Controller input system isn't finished yet.

There is no tutorial in the game yet, so here are the controls:
- Movement - WASD
- Looking - Mouse Movement
- Sprint - Shift
- Jump - Spacebar
- Interact (with ladders) - E
- Pause - Escape-Key

## Issues
Jumping while sprinting does not always work.
You can fall off the map by walking off (dont do that).
The buttons of the pause menu are mostly non-functioning, except for Resume and Main Menu.
